# Advanced-Machine-Learning

This project aimes to use machine learning on particle collision data.\n
The project participants are 
* William Hirst 
* Sakarias Frette

Both are Computational phycisists that will work with machine learning onÂ \n
particle collision data from CERN on their master degrees. 

More information will come.
