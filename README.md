# Advanced-Machine-Learning

This project aimes to use machine learning on particle collision data.
The project participants are 
* William Hirst 
* Sakarias Frette

Both are Computational physicists that will work with machine learning onÂ 
particle collision data from CERN on their master degrees. 

To run the code in the Codebase folder, simply run the following command
```
pip3 install -r requirements
```
